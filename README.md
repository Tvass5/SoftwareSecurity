I believe that I did a very good job at identifing some of Artemis Financial's security vulnerabilities by looking at the code. It's very important to code securely so that we ensuring that we are protecting the company from hackers that might be seeking to gain access to client and/or business data. Software security helps to provide the company with peace of mind knowing that their information is well protected, it also plays a huge role in protecting the company's retutation and reliability in the long run.
